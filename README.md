# 🔐 Simple Password Generator

A **Python-based GUI Password Generator** developed using **Tkinter** as part of my **Remote Internship Task #2** in Python Programming.  
This application allows users to create strong, secure passwords with customizable options for length and character sets.  
It also includes a **copy-to-clipboard** feature for quick usage.

## 🚀 Features
- **User-friendly GUI** with Tkinter.
- Customize password:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Digits
  - Symbols
- Adjustable password length.
- **One-click password generation**.
- **Copy to clipboard** feature.
- Hover and pulsating button animations for a better UI experience.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** – GUI development
- **String** – character sets
- **Random** – password generation logic
